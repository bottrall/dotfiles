## Usage

```sh
git clone git@github.com:bottrall/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
./install.sh
```

## How install.sh works

The script detects the OS and symlinks each config file/directory to its corresponding location under `~`. Shared configs are always linked; platform-specific configs (zsh on macOS, bash + Hyprland on Linux) are linked conditionally.

If a file already exists at the target path, it gets moved to `~/.dotfiles-backup/` before the symlink is created. Existing symlinks pointing to the correct source are left as-is, making the script safe to re-run.
