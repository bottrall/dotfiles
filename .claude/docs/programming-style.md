# Programming Style

## Functional Patterns

- Prefer functional programming over imperative/OOP where practical
- Favor immutability, pure functions, and composition
- Avoid side effects; isolate them when necessary

## Error Handling

- Prefer explicit return types over throwing exceptions
- Use Result/Either patterns, discriminated unions, or similar constructs
- Reserve exceptions for truly exceptional circumstances
